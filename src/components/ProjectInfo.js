We then proceeded to sketch out ideas, and then turned those ideas into rough mock-ups to get an idea for the overall look of the bike. ¬†We chose a 70cc engine, which made it easy to work on without an engine hoist, and made the finished bike light and compact. We considered the design of the fuel tank, and realized that it would add visual clutter to bike. ¬†Realizing we could simplify our design by building the fuel tank into the frame, we created a tank underneath the seat. The finished bike incorporates a playful color palette, that speaks to the DIY nature of the project and unconventional design elements.",
